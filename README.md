Pokemon holds a very special place in my heart as it is probably the only video game I have judiciously followed for more than 10 years. With this dataset, I wanted to be able to answer the following questions:  Is it possible to build a classifier to identify legendary Pokemon? How does height and weight of a Pokemon correlate with its various base stats? What factors influence the Experience Growth and Egg Steps? Are these quantities correlated? Which type is the strongest overall? Which is the weakest? Which type is the most likely to be a legendary Pokemon? Can you build a Pokemon dream team? A team of 6 Pokemon that inflicts the most damage while remaining relatively impervious to any other team of 6 Pokemon.
